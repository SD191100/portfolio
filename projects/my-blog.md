## 📚 What I Learned

During the development of this blog, I gained hands-on experience with:

- **Next.js App Router & File-Based Routing**: Built dynamic routes for blog posts using slugs.  
- **Content Fetching with Markdown**: Created a content system using local markdown files + gray-matter for metadata.  
- **SEO & Performance**: Leveraged Next.js metadata API and optimized rendering techniques.  
- **Dynamic Tag Pages**: Created an Explore section to filter blog posts based on tags.  
- **Dark Mode Support** *(if added)*: Managed themes using Tailwind CSS and context/state.  
- **Deploying with Vercel**: Set up CI/CD pipelines for automatic deploys on push.
